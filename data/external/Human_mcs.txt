This interaction occurs when the activated G-CSFR resides in early endosomes.	The protein was validated by mammalian protein–protein interaction trap assay, immunoprecipitations, Bio-G-CSF pull-downs, western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy in HeLa cells, HEK293T cells and HL60 cells, and the study suggests that the antioxidant protein Prdx4 negatively controls G-CSF signalling in the early endosome compartment by reducing ROS levels in proximity of the ER, thereby keeping Ptp1b active.

These contact sites mediate transfer of the microtubule motor kinesin 1 from protrudin to the motor adaptor FYCO1 on LEs.	The protein was validated by microscopy, western blotting, GFP-trap assay in HeLa cells, HEK293 cells; hTERT-RPE1 cells and HL60 cells, and these results correlate strongly with the cooperative effects of protrudin and FYCO1 in protrusion and neurite outgrowth.

The protein was validated by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, live cell imaging, MS and EM in HeLa cells, which via a countertransport mechanism, negatively regulates PI4P in the PM. 	28970484	ORP5 and ORP8 are reported to localize to endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions via binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), and act as a PtdIns(4)P/phosphatidylserine counter exchanger between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane.	The protein was validated by immunoblot and confocal microscopy in HeLa cells, which binds phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and regulate its level at the plasma membrane.	29472386	PI(4,5)P2 controls plasma membrane PI4P and PS levels via ORP5/8 recruitment to ER–PM contact sites.	The protein was validated by live-cell confocal imaging, SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis in HEK293-AT1 cells and COS-7 cells, which differentially regulates PM PI4P levels through different engagement with the PM.
